Analysis and visualization of employee attendance data.


By developing a Power BI dashboard, I enabled the HR team to efficiently monitor employee attendance data, such as working hours, performance, and leaves.
To create an interactive dashboard for the HR team, I began by performing ETL on the employee data provided by the HR team using Power Query. I then developed measures in Power BI to facilitate identifying patterns and trends in employee attendance data. This streamlined the data analysis process, enabling the HR team to easily monitor employee attendance and identify areas for improvement.
